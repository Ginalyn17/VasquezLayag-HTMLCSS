				<p>"My favorite espresso. Anyone who enjoys a good espresso should definitely order their espresso!! And its clean, like all their coffee; no added poisons. Can't beat that. Enjoy!!- Dr. Vinny</p>
				<p>"I purchased your coffee (coffee lover's blend) this weekend at Rice's and I am hoooked. I opened my bag of beans and the aroma was incredible. I never realized that the coffee could smell that good. I couldn't wait to grind them up and make a pot. By far the best coffee I have ever brewed at home. I am going to be spreading the word to my other coffee lovers. Thank you."- Mark Broomel</p>
				<p>"Very delicious, very flavorful. Fresh Coffee Scoop is my new favorite coffee! Thank you!!" - Justine Peterson</p>
				<p>"Your coffee hits the spot every time. Thank you for the experience of pure, delicious coffee masterfully roasted! I will never purchase any other and I will spread the word!" - Bea Curtiz</p>
